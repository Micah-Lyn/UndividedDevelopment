1. Introduction
Math City is an application developed to reinforce fifth grade mathematical concepts such as the 
measurement of geometric shapes which includes calculating the area, perimeter, and volume. The 
application aims to broaden the understanding of the named concepts using tactile learning methods that 
are appealing both visually and auditorily. Our overall goal for this project is to provide a 
non-traditional, outside-of-the-box learning environment to our users, and to create a space where math 
is less intimidating and much more enjoyable than reading a textbook or practicing with a worksheet.

3.1 Beginner Map        

Concepts covered : 
Perimeter, Area

Description:
The beginner difficulty map has 3 levels: levels 1 and 2 contain simple problems related to an area and 
perimeter of a particular geometric shape. Here, the player has to click the scene where they enter a 
shop. In the shop, they will be prompted with questions about where they have to do drag and drop items 
as per the instructions. If they get it right in one attempt, they will move to the next problem. 
Otherwise there is a Help button where they get hints and get to watch the tutorial on how to solve that
question. After these 2 levels, the third one is final.

Perimeter:
Opens the beginner perimeter activity.
See 3.1.1 for details.

Area:

After clicking, a popup window will warn the user that upon clicking Back progress will be lost. Users 
can select “Ok” to go back to the Main Menu, “Cancel” which stays on the beginner map. Or the user can 
simply click “X” on the top right of the popup to close the popup and return to the beginner map.
